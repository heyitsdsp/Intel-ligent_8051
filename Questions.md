# Programming questions 

1.	Write an assembly language program to interface LEDs and switches with the 8051 microcontroller, in which normally the LEDs should display the lights in the pattern of – two LEDs should glow in which one led should go off first and followed by the next, and this should scroll from right to left when input port pin P0.0 is reset and scrolling should happen from left to right when the port pin P0.0 is set.

2.	Write an assembly language program to interface LEDs and switches with 8051 microcontroller, in which a single led should go from right to left (turning on) and vice versa 4 times and then all LEDs should be turned on if port pin P0.0 is reset and when P0.0 is set 1 LED from left should go (turning on) to the centre and 1 led from right should go to the centre – this should happen 4 times and then all LEDs should constantly glow. 

3.	Write an assembly language program to interface seven segment LED with 8051 microcontroller, the display should display the numbers in ascending order sequence normally and when external interrupt 0 is activated the numbers should be displayed in descending order.

4.	Write an assembly language program to interface LCD with 8051 microcontroller and make the screen display your name normally, when External Interrupt 0 is activated it should display your register number.

5.	Write an assembly language program to interface LEDs and switches with the 8051 microcontroller, in which normally the LEDs should display the lights in the pattern of – all LEDs should glow in the beginning and gradually each LEDs should turn off from right to left normally and when external interrupt 0 is activated it should happen from left to right when the port pin P0.0 is set.

6.	Write an assembly language program to generate a square wave with timer (timer in mode 2) interrupt with 10μs time delay. Use external interrupt to change the delay to 20 μs.

7.	Write an assembly language program to generate two square waves with 10 μs delay but 1800 phase shifted with each other.

8.	Write an assembly language program to generate squarewave of 50Hz frequency normally and the frequency should change to 100 Hz when the port pin P0.0 is reset.

9.	Write an assembly language program to interface LEDs and switches with the 8051 microcontroller, in which normally the LEDs should display the lights in the pattern of – all LEDs should glow in the beginning and gradually each LEDs should turn off from right to left and when external interrupt 0 is activated turning off should happen from left to right.

10.	Write a program to count the number of vowels in the given string. Get string input from RAM location 45H. String “MICRO”. 

11. Write an 8051-assembly program to 
    1. Create a Square wave of 66 % duty cycle on bit 5 of port 1.
    2. Create a Square wave of 75 % duty cycle on bit 3 of port 2.
